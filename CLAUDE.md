# Vauban - Claude Code Guidelines

## 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes wrong, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

## 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents frequently to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute via subagents
- Assign one task per subagent for focused execution

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After any correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself to prevent repeating the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at the start of each session

## 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, and demonstrate correctness

## 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes, ask: "Is there a more elegant solution?"
- If a fix feels hacky, ask: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution."
- Skip this for simple fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it
- Use logs, errors, and failing tests to diagnose
- Require zero context switching from the user
- Fix failing CI tests automatically

## Task Management

1. **Plan First** – Write the plan in `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan** – Confirm the plan before implementation
3. **Track Progress** – Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes** – Provide a high-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results** – Add a review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons** – Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Environment

- Use **sdkman** to manage Java and Maven versions
- Required: **Java 25** (`sdk use java 25.ea.4-open` or equivalent)
- Required: **Maven 4** (`sdk use maven 4.0.0-rc-5`)
- If `mvn` fails with "modelVersion 4.1.0 not supported", Maven `current` has been reset to 3.x — switch back to 4.x

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First
Make every change as simple as possible and minimize code impact.

### No Laziness
Find root causes. Avoid temporary fixes. Maintain senior-level engineering standards.
